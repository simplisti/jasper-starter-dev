JasperStarter appears to have a few issues:

1. All output is sent to stderr, so even successfull compilation output seems to be sent to stderr, not stdout - we cannot separate error from output
2. The -o <outputFile> option doesn't seem to work - it gives an error about file.jasper cannot be written
3. MySQL 10+ requires ?useSSL=true query option which can only be provided via the --db-uri switch but seems buggy?

NOTE:
I may have been missing the `libmysql-java` as part of the mysql install in Vagrantfile which resulted in mysql JDBC errors
